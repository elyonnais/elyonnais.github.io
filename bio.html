        Emily Lyonnais is a junior who is working towards getting her BFA in Visual Communication Design. Although not currently working in design, she does work at a chocolate shop, which is pretty much the next best thing. She has also been on short study abroad trips to Spain and Costa Rica, is an avid doodler, and enjoys painting, drawing, and printmaking.
